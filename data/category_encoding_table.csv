# CRITICAL TIER-2 NOTE:
# All entries above are Tier-2 semantic hypotheses (PHTS v3.0, Section 6.1)
# These are CONSISTENT WITH but NOT PROVEN BY the structural evidence
# They cannot be independently verified without a bilingual anchor text
# Confidence values are researcher estimates, not statistically validated
# The category encoding discovery (fachys=Viola AND Belladonna) is the
# primary empirical anchor (PHTS v3.0, Section 6.1)
#
# KEY DISCOVERY: 'fachys' appears for f9v (Viola, Cold-Moist) and
# f1v (Belladonna, Cold-Dry). Shared quality: COLD → encodes CATEGORY,
# not specific plant. This is the Category Encoding System pivot point.
